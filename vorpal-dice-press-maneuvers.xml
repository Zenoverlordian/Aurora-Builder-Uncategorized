            <p class="indent">Some of your maneuvers require the target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuvers effects. The saving throw is calculated as:</p>
            <center>
                <p><strong>Maneuver save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength of Dexterity modifier (your choice)</p>
